# 05 â€” Intro to Bash Scripting

---

## Scenario

To automate routine tasks and streamline system administration, I learned the basics of Bash scripting. This module gave me the ability to create simple shell scripts for performing file operations, gathering input, controlling flow with conditionals and loops, and working with arguments. Mastery of these basics is essential for cybersecurity professionals who frequently need to script tasks, build tooling, and automate defensive or investigative workflows.

## What I Did

- Wrote and ran a basic script:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Hello, $USER. Welcome to Bash scripting!"
  ```
- Used variables and arithmetic:
  ```bash
  a=5
  b=3
  sum=$((a + b))
  echo "Sum: $sum"
  ```
- Accepted user input using `read`:
  ```bash
  read name
  echo "Nice to meet you, $name!"
  ```
- Wrote a conditional statement:
  ```bash
  if [ "$USER" == "root" ]; then
    echo "You're the root user."
  else
    echo "You're a regular user."
  fi
  ```
- Used a loop to print lines:
  ```bash
  for i in {1..5}
  do
    echo "Line $i"
  done
  ```
- Created a script with arguments:
  ```bash
  echo "Hello, $1!"
  ```
- Wrote a file existence checker:
  ```bash
  if [ -f "$1" ]; then
    echo "File $1 exists."
  else
    echo "File $1 does not exist."
  fi
  ```

## What I Learned

- Scripts should begin with a shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) to define the interpreter
- `chmod +x` makes a script executable
- Variables are declared without a `$` but referenced with one
- User input is read using `read`, and arguments are passed using `$1`, `$2`, etc.
- `if` statements and `for` loops form the backbone of Bash logic
- Scripts should be tested and debugged incrementally to avoid syntax errors
- Even from a Zsh shell, Bash scripts run predictably when invoked with `#!/bin/bash`

## Why It Matters

Bash scripting is a core competency for cybersecurity professionals. Whether writing scripts to automate reconnaissance, parse logs, perform batch scans, or manage user accounts, being fluent in Bash enables powerful task automation in Linux. It saves time, reduces error, and is fundamental to blue team workflows, incident response, and red team toolkit development.
