# 02 — Vulnerability Scanning with Greenbone

---

## Scenario

After mastering Nmap scanning, I needed a full‑featured vulnerability scanner to emulate real SOC workflows. I installed the **Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM)** stack on my Kali VM, then battled through database, disk‑space, and service‑startup issues until I could launch a “Full and Fast” scan against localhost. The troubleshooting mirrors what a junior analyst might face when maintaining internal scanning appliances.

## What I Did

- **Installed and initialized GVM**
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install gvm -y
  sudo gvm-setup
  ```
- **Discovered PostgreSQL failure due to 100 % disk usage**
  ```bash
  df -h
  find / -type f -size +100M | head
  sudo apt clean && sudo apt autoremove
  ```
- **Rebuilt the Postgres cluster and created the GVM database**
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start postgresql@17-main
  sudo runuser -u postgres -- /usr/share/gvm/create-postgresql-database
  ```
- **Verified services and feeds**
  ```bash
  sudo gvm-check-setup
  sudo greenbone-feed-sync --type GVMD_DATA
  ```
- **Launched the web UI, configured target, and ran a *Full and Fast* scan**
  - URL: `https://127.0.0.1:9392`
  - Target: `127.0.0.1`
  - Scan Config: *Full and fast*

## What I Learned

> 🎯 **Key Takeaways**

- Disk exhaustion silently breaks database‑driven security tools.
- `journalctl -xeu <service>` is indispensable for pinpointing service crashes.
- GVM relies on multiple daemons (PostgreSQL, Redis, ospd‑openvas) — each must be healthy.
- Feed synchronization can be forced with `greenbone-feed-sync` when the UI throws errors.
- A *Full and Fast* scan provides quick CVE coverage ideal for baseline audits.

## Why It Matters

Hands‑on experience with a scanning platform moves me from simple enumeration to **actionable vulnerability assessment**, the
